# MasterCal-API
I wanted to make an app to avoid using CalDavZAP but I didn't have the skills to be an Android dev. So I made this API and took advantage of the fact that Google already invented the wheel with Google Calendar.

## Setup
1. Go to [https://biskweet.freeboxos.fr/mastercal/](https://biskweet.freeboxos.fr/mastercal/)
2. Fill in your major and your courses (starting with the major) and copy your personal generated link
3. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) or any other calendar app that supports importing and syncing from URL (I will use Google Calendar in the setup)
4. In the upper right corner of your screen, click the gear icon on the left of your Google account profile picture and choose _Settings_
   
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./img/screenshot1.png" width="500px" height="auto">
   </div>
   
6. On the left of your screen, unwrap the _Add calendar_ submenu and click _From URL_
   
   <div align="center">
     <img src="./img/screenshot2.png" width="500px" height="auto">
   </div>

8. Fill in the link you copied and add the calendar. It's going to load for a bit because it's downloading all events
9. (Optional) You can customize the name and color of your calendar
    
   <div align="center" display="flex">
     <img src="./img/screenshot3.png" width="300px" height="auto">
     <img src="./img/screenshot4.png" width="300px" height="auto">
   </div>
  
11. ⚠️ Now head to your Google Calendar phone app and open settings
12. ⚠️ Under the Google account you used, click _Show more_. Your new calendar is hidden there. Press the calendar item (it might be an ugly link).
13. ⚠️ Finally, press _Sync_ to enable syncing on your phone. Voilà!
